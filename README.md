Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

1) Introduction/Business Problem
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Idea is to be able to predict weekly billable lobor hours of an employee considering that he/she works nine hours a day. Prediction should be into consideration reduced hours due to plannned and unplanned vacations and public holidays which would reduce the labour hours accordingly.

2) Downloading and Prepping Data

Data contains weekly labour hours for all the employees since 2018. using that we will predict weekly average billable hours for 2020. This would help a service sector organization with their better predcition on costs and profits.



3) Methodology
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

Seasonal Arima model has been used for this prediction.

4) Results
Results section where you discuss the results.

Results show weekly aveage labour hours per employee for 2020.

5) Discussion
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.


6) Conclusion
